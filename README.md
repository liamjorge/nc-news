# 📰 NC News API

This is an API for a news discussion website (similar to reddit). The API uses GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE methods to interact with a postgres database which contains articles, comments, users and topics.

This is a back-end portfolio project for the [Northcoders bootcamp](https://northcoders.com). A front-end will be added later in the course.

A hosted version of the API is available here: [https://liamjorge-nc-news.herokuapp.com/api](https://liamjorge-nc-news.herokuapp.com/api)
